WARNING!

Do not commit builds (installers and such), as these files can easily reach over 100MB in size, which means we will no longer be able to push to the repository.

Instead, if you want to use an installer, build it on your own system using the command "npm run-script build-win" in the main folder of the rep. You'll be able to find the installer here afterwards. Move the installer to a safe location and make sure not to push it!
